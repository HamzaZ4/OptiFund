## DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DAILY RETURN AND CUMULATIVE RETURN:

### Daily Return

The daily return reprents the total returns of a stock based on yesterday's price
measured up agains today's price
can be calculated using this formula:

rt​=Pt−1​Pt​​−1

### The cumulative return

The cumulative return represents the total returns of an investment since the investment itself
It can be calculating using this formula:
Rt​=i=1∏t​(1+ri​)−1

### The simple moving average

It's an arithmetic average of asset prices over a specified period.
It can be calculated by summing the prices of recent data points and
dividing by the number of periods to create a single data point

#### Why it matters to investors?

It matters because:
Smooths out the wiggles in daily prices.
Reduces nois, Identifying trends ( if it's rising, it suggests the stock is in an uptrend
; if failing, in a downtrend ), Support and resistance: Prices often bounce near their SMA levels.

### The exponential moving average

This is a indicator that tracks the price of a financial asset over a specified period
by giving more weight to the recent price data than older data, which makes it more responsive
to current market fluctuations

#### Why it matters to investors?

The **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** is a tool investors use to track price action and momentum within a timeframe.

- Unlike the **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**, which gives equal weight to all past prices, the EMA puts more weight on recent signals.
- This makes it react faster to changes while still smoothing out noise.
- SMA tends to lag, but EMA smooths just enough while staying close to the current price.

Because of this, EMAs are often treated as **dynamic support or resistance zones**. That makes them useful for setting stop-losses or scaling into positions at points where many other investors are reacting.

#### Example usage of the EMA: EMA Pullback Entry

You want to invest **$3,000** in Company X.

**GOING ALL IN**  
If you buy all $3,000 at once and the price immediately dips, that hurts…  
You’ve bet everything on a single entry price, even though markets are messy and prices fluctuate often.

**SCALING STRATEGY USING EMA**  
Instead of buying all $3,000 at once, you split it into three chunks of $1,000.

- If the stock keeps rising, at least your first $1,000 gains.
- If it dips, you still have $2,000 to invest at better levels.

**EMA ENTERED THE CHAT →**  
In an uptrend, EMAs often act as support. So instead of adding randomly, you plan your next entries around pullbacks to the EMA.

Example:

1. **Breakout buy:** Invest $1,000 at $100. You get early exposure to the trend if it continues rising.
2. **Pullback to EMA:** Price dips to the 21-EMA at $98. Because EMAs act like dynamic support in uptrends, this dip is more likely to be a healthy correction than a reversal. Investors see the EMA level as a “fairer” price than the stretched $100, so demand comes back in. You add $1,000.
3. **EMA respected again:** Price rallies, then retests near the EMA at $99. Seeing support hold, you add your final $1,000.

**Good concept to research:** the _Moving Average Ribbon_, which layers multiple EMAs to show trend strength and momentum visually.
